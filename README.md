I have Done an app with Login Credentials stored in ROOM Database.


Simple Login app ..Which Includes Main activty as having 2 options : Login or Register
We have to choose one and followed by it.
Coming to code..For UI i used XML
For code files i used KOTLIN
DATABASE used as ROOM
Including DAO, Repositiory, DataClass, Interface,UserViewModel.



The Dependencies used specially are:

dependencies {
    implementation "androidx.room:room-runtime:2.6.1"
    kapt "androidx.room:room-compiler:2.6.1"
    implementation "androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-viewmodel-ktx:2.6.1"
}

Based on the version we have to update it.
